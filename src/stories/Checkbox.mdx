# Checkbox

The `Checkbox` component allows users to select one or more items from a set. It is commonly used for selections, toggles, and to present users with multiple choices. The `checked` property determines the initial value to be set.

<Controls />

### Importing Checkbox

To integrate the Checkbox component into your application, use the following import statement:

```tsx
import Checkbox from '@sendbird/uikit-react/ui/Checkbox';
```

### Examples
The Checkbox component can be used in various states, as demonstrated below:

#### Unchecked
Represents a Checkbox in its default state, not selected.

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.Unchecked} />

#### Checked
Shows the Checkbox in a selected state.

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.Checked} />

#### Disabled Unchecked
Illustrates a Checkbox that is disabled and not selected, indicating that the user cannot interact with it.

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.DisabledUnchecked} />

#### Disabled Checked
Displays a Checkbox that is both selected and disabled, showing that the selection is permanent or cannot be changed by the user interaction.

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.DisabledChecked} />
