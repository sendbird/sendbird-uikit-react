# ChannelSettings Component
The `ChannelSettings` component is responsible for managing and viewing information about the channel as well as its participating members.
<br/>It allows updating channel information, freezing the channel chat window as a channel operator, and muting or banning members.
<br/>Additionally, it allows making other members operators or revoking their operator status.

<Canvas of={ChannelSettingsStories.Default} />
<Controls />

To integrate the Avatar component into your project, use the following import statement:
```tsx
import { ChannelSettings } from '@sendbird/uikit-react/ChannelSettings';
import { ChannelSettingsProvider, useChannelSettingsContext } from '@sendbird/uikit-react/ChannelSettings/context';
```
