# BottomSheet

The `BottomSheet` component is designed to present content in a sliding panel from the bottom of the screen, commonly used for menus, selecting options, or displaying information in a contained space that does not take over the entire screen. This component is highly effective for mobile-responsive designs and enhances user interaction within the application.

<Canvas of={BottomSheetStories.Default} />
<ArgsTable of={BottomSheet} />

To incorporate the BottomSheet component into your project, use the following import statement:

```tsx
import BottomSheet from '@sendbird/uikit-react/ui/BottomSheet';
```
