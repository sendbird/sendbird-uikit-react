# How to define reducers

Reducers are functions that take the current state and an action,
and return a new state. Reducers are pure functions, which means they
should not mutate the state, but return a new state object

In this project we recommend using minimal external dependencies,
so we recommend using built-in hooks like useState and useReducer

You can use useState if the component is simple, otherwise you can move to useReducer and move side effects into customHooks

# RULES for this project(April 10 2023)

* Patterns for keeping reducers simple, typesafe, uniform and readable
* Use Plop to generate boilerplate code

```javascript

// intialState.ts
export interface ${Prefix}StateType {
  sdk: SendbirdChat,
  loading: boolean,
}

const initialState: ${Prefix}StateType = {
  loading: false,
  sdk: {} as SendbirdChat,
};

// actionTypes.ts
import { CreateAction } from "./utils/typeHelpers/CreateAction/reducers";

export const ${PREFIX}_ACTIONS = {
  SET_SDK: "SET_SDK",
  SET_LOADING: "SET_LOADING",
} as const;

type ${PREFIX}_PAYLOAD_TYPES = {
  [${PREFIX}_ACTIONS.SET_SDK]: {
    sdk: SendbirdChat,
  },
  [${PREFIX}_ACTIONS.SET_LOADING]: boolean,
};

export type ${Prefix}ActionTypes = CreateAction<PAYLOAD_TYPES>;

// reducer.ts
import { ${Prefix}ActionTypes, ${PREFIX}_ACTIONS } from "./actionTypes";
import { ${Prefix}StateType } from "./initialState";

export const ${prefix}Reducer = (
  state: ${Prefix}StateType,
  action: ${Prefix}ActionTypes,
): ${Prefix}StateType => {
  return  match(action)
    .with({ type: ${PREFIX}_ACTIONS.SET_SDK }, (action) => ({
      ...state,
      sdk: action.payload.sdk,
    }))
    .with({ type: ${PREFIX}_ACTIONS.SET_LOADING }, (action) => ({
      ...state,
      loading: action.payload,
    }))
};

// in component
import { ${prefix}Reducer, initialState } from "./reducer";
import { ${Prefix}ActionTypes, ${PREFIX}_ACTIONS } from "./actionTypes";

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(${prefix}Reducer, initialState);

```
