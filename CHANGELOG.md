## [3.0.0-beta] (Apr 12 2022)

This is the official beta for Sendbird UIKit for React version 3!

TLDR -> We split the old `smart-components` into modules which contian context and UI. Context contain logic and UI Components handle UI

**[Check out the v2 to v3 migration guide for details](MIGRATION_v2-to-v3.md)**

Changelog:
* Package should be installed using `@sendbird/uikit-react`
* Restructure smart-components into modules that contain a context and related UI components
* Export these context and UI components to allow fine-grain customization
* Recommend to use these context elements `useXXXXX()` and react function components to make custom components
* All generic UI components are available as exports
* Restrcuture export paths to allow better tree-shaking
* Example:
```
import { useChannel } from '@sendbird/uikit-react/Channel/context';
import ChannelUI from '@sendbird/uikit-react/Channel/components/ChannelUI';
```
* We keep older export patterns to make migration easier
* Retained modules - ChannelList, Channel, ChannelSettings, OpenChannel, OpenChannelSettings, MessageSearch
* New modules(not including context and ui of above) - CreateChannel, EditUserProfile, ui
