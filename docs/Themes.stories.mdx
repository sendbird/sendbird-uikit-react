# Theme Modes

* We support two theme modes for now - `light` and `dark` which can be passed as prop to `<App />` and `<SendbirdProvider />` component
* Since we follow BEM stylesheet, user can use CSS classnames to customize specific components

> Future: Once we opensource the project user can extend the theme definitions to add custom themes
